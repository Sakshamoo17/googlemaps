HTML Elements
An HTML element usually consists of a start tag and end tag, with the content inserted in between:

<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

<p>My first paragraph.</p>
Start tag	Element content	End tag
<h1>	My First Heading	</h1>
<p>	My first paragraph.	</p>
<br>	 	 
HTML elements with no content are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag, such as the <br> element (which indicates a line break).

Nested HTML Elements
HTML elements can be nested (elements can contain elements).

All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.
